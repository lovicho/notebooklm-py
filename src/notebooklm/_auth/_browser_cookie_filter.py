    """Filter a Playwright ``storage_state`` dict to the configured cookie-domain policy.

    The Playwright login flow captures every cookie the browser context holds.
    Without this filter, sibling-product cookies (``mail.google.com``,
    ``myaccount.google.com``, ``docs.google.com``, ``.youtube.com``) the user
    happens to be signed into leak into the persisted ``storage_state.json``
    and inflate the blast radius. This applies the same allowlist the rookiepy
    path uses (:func:`_build_google_cookie_domains`) at write time so both
    login paths produce equivalent on-disk state, opt-in via
    ``--include-domains=...``. The match is exact-against-allowlist with
    leading-dot/no-dot equivalence (``http.cookiejar`` may normalize either);
    sibling subdomains are deliberately NOT matched by a broad ``.google.com``
    suffix — that's the bug being fixed.

    Two hardening behaviors (#1513) ride on top of the allowlist:

    * **Malformed rows are skipped, not raised.** rookiepy / Playwright can
      emit malformed rows; a non-dict entry, a cookie whose ``domain`` is not
      a str, or a cookie whose ``name`` is not a non-empty str (all malformed
      under Playwright's own ``storage_state`` schema) is dropped with one
      bounded ``logger.warning`` per row instead of crashing the whole persist.
      The warning logs only a **value-free shape** (:func:`_safe_cookie_shape`:
      the row's keys + per-field types) — never the row itself — so a cookie
      ``value`` (a live credential, and for the CDP arm one that comes straight
      from the operator's running browser) cannot leak into the logs.
    * **Exact-identity duplicate dedup.** Rows are keyed by their full
      RFC 6265 identity ``(name, domain, path)`` (path normalized via
      ``or "/"``, matching every loader). For exact-identity duplicates —
      where only metadata such as ``value`` / ``expires`` / flags can differ —
      the **last occurrence in input order wins** and replaces the earlier row
      in place, kept whole (fields are never merged). This mirrors the
      persistence-merge rule in
      :func:`notebooklm._auth.storage.save_cookies_to_storage`, where the
      newer observation overwrites the stored row for the same
      ``(name, domain, path)`` key.

      Same-name rows on *different* domains or paths are deliberately ALL
      kept: cross-domain same-name resolution is a **load-time** concern (the
      flat loaders :func:`notebooklm._auth.cookies.extract_cookies_from_storage`
      / :func:`notebooklm._auth.cookies.flatten_cookie_map` rank by
      ``_auth_domain_priority``). Deduping by bare name at write time would
      starve the ``(name, domain, path)``-keyed runtime loader
      (:func:`notebooklm._auth.cookies.build_httpx_cookies_from_storage`),
      which legitimately holds e.g. the per-product ``OSID`` cookie on
      ``notebooklm.google.com`` and ``myaccount.google.com`` as distinct
      jar entries.

    Args:
        state: Playwright ``storage_state`` dict (``BrowserContext.storage_state()``).
        include_optional: When ``True``, opt in to every label in
            :data:`notebooklm._auth.cookie_policy.OPTIONAL_COOKIE_DOMAINS_BY_LABEL`.
        include_domains: Optional-domain labels to opt in (``"all"`` = every
            label). Mirrors the rookiepy path semantics.

    Returns:
        A new ``storage_state`` dict with ``cookies`` filtered and ``origins``
        copied verbatim. The input dict is not mutated.
