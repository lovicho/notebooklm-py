    The homepage GET requires *at least one* of two secondary-binding paths in
    addition to Tier 1:

    - ``OSID`` (recent-sign-in binding), OR
    - ``APISID`` AND ``SAPISID`` (legacy XSSI pair) **AND** bare ``LSID``.

    Without one of those, Google 302s to ``accounts.google.com/v3/signin`` even
    when ``SID`` and ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` are present and otherwise valid.

    The ``LSID`` conjunct is the correction. The original pair-wise ablation
    only varied ``OSID`` and the XSSI pair; because ``APISID``/``SAPISID`` are
    ``.google.com``-scoped they survived every domain filter, so the XSSI branch
    was never tested *without* them and the ``LSID`` dependency stayed hidden.
    A three-way ablation, replicated on two unrelated accounts (2026-08-04,
    issue #1977), gives:

    ==========  =====================  ============  ========
    ``OSID``    ``APISID``+``SAPISID``  bare ``LSID``  result
    ==========  =====================  ============  ========
    present     --                     --            works
    present     present                --            works
    --          present                present       works

    --          --                     present       fails
    ==========  =====================  ============  ========

    Row 4 is what this function used to get wrong. Two consequences worth
    keeping straight:

    * ``OSID`` alone is sufficient — a profile with **no** ``LSID`` anywhere
      authenticates (row 1, verified with every ``accounts.google.com`` cookie
      stripped). ``LSID`` is required *only* when ``OSID`` is absent.
    * ``__Host-1PLSID`` / ``__Host-3PLSID`` do **not** substitute for bare
      ``LSID``; row 4 retains them and still fails.

    Deliberately domain-blind, and that is not the #2054 mistake. ``LSID`` is
    ``accounts.google.com``-scoped and never routes to the app host, while
    ``OSID`` is app-host-scoped — the binding spans hosts because the auth flow
    does (app-host GET, redirect through accounts, back). A check restricted to
    what routes to the *target* URL would reject working profiles. Host-aware,
    were it ever needed, would mean "``OSID`` routable to the app host, or the
    XSSI pair routable there plus ``LSID`` present for the accounts hop" — not a
    single routed header.

    that rotating ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` could plausibly produce a working
    session" — a precondition for attempting recovery, not for succeeding.

    The difference is the ``LSID`` conjunct. Rotation POSTs to
    ``accounts.google.com``; whether that hop can itself re-establish the
    accounts-side session (and so supply the missing ``LSID``) has not been
    ablated. Requiring the *post*-recovery condition before *attempting*
    recovery would gate off the rotation that might satisfy it — checking the

    """Return the both-hosts caveat to append to "open the app in your browser" advice.

    Every hint that tells a user to open the NotebookLM app in their browser is
    really telling them to *mint the per-product binding cookie* (``OSID`` /
    ``__Secure-OSID``). Google now serves the personal app from two hosts and
    redirects between them, and those binding cookies are **host-scoped**: a
    cookie set on one host is never sent to the other. So the browser visit can
    succeed and still leave the configured host without a binding — which is the
    #2019 shape all over again (a working session read as an expired one).

    Naming a different URL in the advice does not fix that: the redirect happens
    either way. What the user needs is the *outcome* named — which host the
    cookies landed on, which host this client is talking to — plus a recovery
    that works. Hence this note, appended to the binding-related hints.

    Both recoveries are real, and ordered deliberately:

    1. Re-run ``notebooklm login`` and complete the sign-in. That re-mints the
       account-wide cookies. ``APISID`` + ``SAPISID`` live on ``.google.com``
       and ``LSID`` on ``accounts.google.com``, so none of them are host-scoped
       and together they satisfy the binding on *either* host — see
       :func:`_has_valid_secondary_binding`.
    2. Select the host that actually holds the cookies via
       ``NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL``.

    Recovery 2 carries a caveat, but only in one direction. The sibling host is
    computed *relative to the configured one*, so it is the rebrand host
    (:data:`notebooklm._env.PERSONAL_APP_ALIAS_HOST`) for a default-host user and
    the long-established default for a rebrand-host user. Attaching the caveat
    unconditionally therefore warned rebrand-host users off the legacy host —
    exactly backwards, and it discourages the one fallback whose behavior this
    project has exercised end to end.

    What the caveat may and may not claim: a live probe (issue #1977) reached
    ``batchexecute`` on the rebrand host — a 400 on a deliberately malformed
    payload proves the endpoint is there. So the host is *not* "unverified to
    serve the API". It is simply experimental here: not the documented default,
    and not covered by this repository's cassettes. The note says that and no
    more — overclaiming in either direction sends users into a different failure,
    which is the bug this note exists to avoid.

    Returns:
        The note as plain text (no trailing newline), or ``""`` when the
        configured host has no sibling — i.e. the enterprise host, which has no
        alias, so there is no cross-host scope to warn about.

      cannot help because Google rejects requests without the binding cookies.

    - Secondary binding missing (Tier-2 warning case): the session works for

    Thin alias of :func:`_is_allowed_cookie_domain`. Both auth-jar building
    and download-cookie loading (and the persistence path that filters which

    1. Exact match against :data:`REQUIRED_COOKIE_DOMAINS` (covers the API
       host, ``.google.com`` / ``accounts.google.com`` /
       ``.googleusercontent.com`` / ``drive.google.com``, and the

    2. Regional Google ccTLDs (``.google.com.sg``, ``.google.co.uk``,

       ``accounts.google.com``) and ``.googleusercontent.com`` /
       ``.usercontent.google.com`` for authenticated media downloads.

    The previous strict / broad split (#334 / fea8315) created an asymmetry
    where ``save_cookies_to_storage`` would persist cookies that the next
    extraction would silently drop. Issue #360 collapsed both filters into
    this single policy. The cookie-domain narrowing control restricts the
    *extraction* surface: ``rookiepy`` requests required domains plus regional
    Google ccTLD variants by default, so YouTube cookies are never written to
    ``storage_state.json`` unless the user opts in via
    ``--include-domains=youtube``. The runtime gate stays permissive over

    Higher value wins. Tiers are **not** distinct: several domains share a tier,
    so the resolved cookie is NOT fully determined by the ranking alone. Where a
    tier is shared, the first occurrence in ``storage_state`` iteration order
    wins, and reordering the file changes the result. The collisions are:

    - **tier 3** — ``.notebooklm.google.com``, ``.notebook.google.com``

    Tier 0 is worth calling out: it holds ``accounts.google.com``, the host the

    route to that POST — is outranked by app-host cookies that do not. Ranking
    by tier is therefore not a substitute for RFC 6265 routing when the question
